# Preparation
## Installation

We assume here that you are familiar with [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook) and have already installed Python and 
relevant packages, e.g., numpy, matplotlib, jupyterlab, etc.

To install the Molass Library package, you can use pip as follows.

```
pip install -U molass
```

## Run Tool for Jupyter Notebooks

For running Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend either of the following without excluding alternatives.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Jupyter Extension in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

## Data for Tutorials

To run the tutorials, you need data, which can be prepared either by

* running [the data generation book](generate_data.ipynb),
* or downloading [the zip file](../../data/sample_data.zip).

The former uses simple, but not necessarily realistic, models to generate the data; while the latter is from a real experiment on some standard proteins. Be aware that you should have installed required packagas before running the book.
