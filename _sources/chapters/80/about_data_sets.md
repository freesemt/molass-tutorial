# About Example Data Sets

This chapter explains how the data sets for this tutorial have been built. They are those referenced in [Download Data for This Tutorial](download_data_for_this_tutorial).

In the next two sections, the followng two data sets will be described.
  * tutorial data
  * simulated above

 To fully understand this chapter, you should be familiar with the following concepts as well as programming basics in Python, which is one of the reasons why we place this chapter later in this tutorial.
  * trimming
  * curve modeling
  * matrix manipulation

Not only for the explanation, this chapter could also serve as an example of data customization using the library.
