Molass Library is a rewrite of [MOLASS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biophysico/20/1/20_e200001/_article) which is an analytical tool for SEC-SAXS experiment data currently hosted at [Photon Factory](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASS.html). It is designed for scripting in Jupyter Notebooks, thereby attaining greater flexibility compared to the predecessor thanks to the Python ecosystem diversity.

This tutorial gets you started with how to use the Molass Library. Follow the chapters of the left sidebar in order. Otherwise, glance over the contents or use the search box to find what you are interested in.
