Molass Library, as its name suggests, is a library style rewrite of [MOLASS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biophysico/20/1/20_e200001/_article), a tool for SEC-SAXS data analysis currently ported at [Photon Factory](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASS.html), designed to be suitable for scripting in Jupyter notebooks, thus aimed at more flexible use in the Python ecosystem, compared to the predecessor.
